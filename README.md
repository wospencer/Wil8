Hi, My name is Will.
I am interested in being an data analyst.
I have basic knowledge of Python, SQL and C++. I have learned the fundamentals of these languanges for fun but started to take more seriously as a profession.
My Githib will be a showcase of my projects. My LinkedIn url is wospencer. I would love to connect too. 
Cheers!
